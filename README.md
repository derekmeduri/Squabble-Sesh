# Squabble-Sesh

## The Pitch

Social media is no new invention - it’s been a big part of our lives and is the foremost way the world interacts. But what is missing from all of these sites we have access to right now?

You’re right! There isn’t enough conflict for conflict’s sake!

Welcome to Squabble Sesh - A new platform where the whole point is just to get into lighthearted debates and squabbles over nothing.
Come try out your debate skills or just take your troll game to the next level.

Keep it light, keep it fun, but most importantly - keep it contentious!
